# Soul_Knight
My first SDL2 game project 
This is a fighting game in which players will be provided with 4 different characters.
There will be a total of 5 maps players need to pass to reach the final level - Boss
After passing each stage, players will be able to upgrade their character to their liking. Dead characters can be resurrected.
How to play:
- A, W, S, D : move button
- SPACE : jump
- Left mouse: normal attack
- E : elemental skill
- Q : ultimate
- Keys 1, 2, 3, 4 in the horizontal number pad row to switch between characters
